## [Network Forensics & Traffic Analysis](https://github.com/joanfx/network-traffic-forensics)
Performed deep packet inspection (DPI) using Wireshark to dissect TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP protocols. Isolated indicators of compromise (IoC) through advanced display filters and payload inspection.

## [Identity & Access Management (IAM)](https://github.com/joanfx/linux-permission-hardening-lab)
Enforced the Principle of Least Privilege by auditing and remediating over-permissive Linux file structures. Utilized chmod and ls -l to harden system assets against unauthorized modification.

## [Security Data Mining & Incident Investigation](https://github.com/joanfx/sql-security-filtering-analysis)
Applied Boolean logic and multi-condition SQL queries to isolate authentication anomalies. Investigated geofencing violations and brute-force patterns within large-scale security logs.

## [Relational Data Correlation & Asset Auditing](https://github.com/joanfx/sql-asset-correlation-audit)
Utilized SQL JOINS to correlate disparate datasets for hardware inventory management. Identified unregistered devices and unassigned assets to eliminate organizational security gaps.
